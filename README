NAME

    Net-DSML - A client interface to a LDAP Directory Services Markup Language 
               (DSML) server.

DESCRIPTION

    This perl module provides support for accessing LDAP through a
    Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) service.
    Using this module a user can search, compare, modify, delete and 
    add LDAP entries using DSML.

    This module was built using the OASIS version 2 Directory Services 
    Markup Language definitions.  This information can be found at the
    following URL:  http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/index.php#dsmlv2
       
    Pod documentation is contained in the Net::DSML, Net::DSML::Filter and
    Net::DSML::Control files.

    Examples of using this module can be found in the module`s 
    Examples directory.

*******************************************************************************

This code should be considered very much as work-in-progress.
Any part of this release could be subject to change.  Since this is the
first release of this module I am quite sure there will be changes as
better ways are found of building the xml messages.
